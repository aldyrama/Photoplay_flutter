## Why should be Modular?

For example, on the left, we can only split the work for two or more developers. But on the right hand side, we can divide the work between five or more developers, and this is also very suitable for large teams because we are dividing the project as modules. So that developers can focus on their respective modules.

If you want to create a `* .g.dart` file, you can use this command in the terminal. But before you run it, make sure you enter the [core] module, using the `cd` command. For example `cd core`. Then you can run the below command.

### Run Flutter app between Flavor for development and production with command prompt

Development
```console
flutter run --flavor development --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-dev.dart
```
Production
```console
flutter run --flavor production --target=lib/ui/launcher/main-prod.dart
```

One time build:
```console
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
or you can watch for changes and rebuild automatically
```console
flutter pub run build_runner watch
```

run package flutter_launcher_icon
```console
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

Firebase messaging to topic
```console
{
	"to": "/topics/your_topic",
	"notification": {
          "message": "body movie 1",
          "title": "title movie 1"
       },
       "priority": "high",
       "data": {
           "body": "body movie",
           "title": "title movie",
           "id": 10,
           "click_action": "FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK",
           "sound": "default",
           "status": "done",
           "screen": "/detailMovieScreen",
           "extradata": ""
       }
}
```
